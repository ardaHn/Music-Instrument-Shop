# Music-Instrument-Shop
A project that consists of 3 different pages. A main page, an 'about us' page and an 'our products' page. Each containing some CSS.

# What is this project?
This is a project I made in order to practice my skills of using both HTML and CSS together. A pretty basic website that the user can scroll through a list of instruments which they can buy. This project was a homework for the patika.dev-front-end path.

# What I learned
In this project I learned a couple of details about how to center certain items such as divs and lists. I also learned the importance of linking the correct HTML and CSS files together.
